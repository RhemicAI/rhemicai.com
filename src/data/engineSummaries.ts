  // Version 1: Original structured approach
  `Think of us as **your tireless team working 24/7** to get your business noticed.

Here's how it works:

**1. We scan your website** — Our AI agents read everything on your site, just like a person would, but much faster.

**2. We audit for AEO** — We benchmark your website and check how your competitors are getting recommended more than you.

**3. We create a report** — You get a clear picture of where you stand and what needs to improve.

**4. We optimize for AI** — We make sure your business shows up when people ask **AI assistants** (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity) for recommendations.

**5. You get recommended** — When potential customers search for what you offer, AI recommends **YOUR business**.

**We do all the heavy lifting** with AI agents. You don't need to understand the technology — we handle everything automatically.

That's what being **fully AI native** means: the technology works for you, not the other way around.`,

  // Version 2: Outcome-focused
  `Your business deserves to be the answer when customers ask AI for recommendations.

We make that happen through a proven process: **scan** your entire website, **audit** where you stand against competitors, **report** the gaps, **optimize** for AI discovery, and get you **recommended** consistently.

Our AI agents handle the technical complexity. You focus on running your business while we ensure AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity recommend you first.`,

  // Version 3: Problem-solution framing
  `Most businesses are invisible to AI search engines. We fix that.

Our engine **analyzes your website**, **benchmarks you against competitors**, **identifies what's holding you back**, then **optimizes everything** so AI assistants recommend your business when customers search.

The result? You become the default answer in AI-powered search results. No guesswork, no manual work — just systematic visibility improvement.`,

  // Version 4: Technical credibility
  `Enterprise-grade AEO built on AI agent infrastructure.

We deploy specialized agents to **crawl your site**, **analyze competitor positioning**, **generate comprehensive reports**, **implement optimizations**, and **monitor recommendation rates** across major AI platforms.

This is systematic visibility engineering. Your business gets recommended because we've optimized every signal AI engines evaluate.`,

  // Version 5: Direct value prop
  `We get your business recommended by AI assistants. Here's the process:

**Scan** — Full website analysis by AI agents

**Recommend** — You become the answer customers see

Fully automated. No ongoing work required from your team.`,

  // Version 6: Customer journey focus
  `When potential customers ask ChatGPT or Claude for recommendations, your business should be the answer.

We make that happen by **scanning your website**, **auditing how competitors rank**, **showing you exactly where you stand**, **optimizing for AI discovery**, then **getting you recommended** consistently.

The technology runs itself. You get the results.`,

  // Version 7: Competitive advantage angle
  `Your competitors are getting recommended by AI. You should be too.

Our process: **deep-scan your website**, **analyze why competitors appear in AI answers**, **create actionable reports**, **implement optimizations**, **secure recommendations** across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini.

This is how you win in AI-powered search. Systematic, measurable, automated.`,

  // Version 8: Simplicity emphasis
